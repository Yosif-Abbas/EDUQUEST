Hi, welcome to the specialization and
information visualization.

2
00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:20.995
My name is Enrico Bertini and I am your
main instructor for the specialization.

3
00:00:20.995 --> 00:00:25.344
I am an associate professor at
the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, and

4
00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:29.845
I have been doing research and teaching
in this area for many, many years.

5
00:00:29.845 --> 00:00:34.685
I am also the co-host of a popular
podcast called Data Stories,

6
00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:39.240
where I talk together with Moritz Stefaner
about data visualization and

7
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.070
anything related to data.

8
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.680
So, my guess is that if you're
watching this video, you've probably

9
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.350
heard of visualization, and
you've also noticed that in recent years,

10
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.250
it grew really,
really a lot in popularity.

11
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.830
So some of the areas
where you may have seen

12
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.070
visualization growing are data journalism.

13
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.640
So there are lots of newspapers
that produce amazing graphics

14
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.040
like The New York Times, Washington Post,
Financial Times and so on.

15
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.480
Another area is vendors and products,
as you saw there are lots of new products.

16
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.560
For instance, Tableau, Qlik,
and open source projects.

17
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.080
Very popular ones like ggplot2, D3,

18
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.350
and a lot of new ones
coming basically every day.

19
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.460
There is also a very thriving
scientific community with new

20
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.930
conferences coming up every year.

21
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.960
Lots of publications at research
labs growing all around the world.

22
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.080
And finally, in data science,
visualization plays a very,

23
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.670
very major role.

24
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.960
And some of the major startups and

25
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.520
companies out there tend to have
strong data visualization groups.

26
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.700
Notable examples are Uber, Netflix,
Capital One, and many others.

27
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.620
So, typically persons who are trying
to learn visualization, or are learning

28
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.370
visualization skills, can use these
skills in many, many different areas.

29
00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.240
So, as I said, in data science,
in data journalism.

30
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.680
You can also become
an independent designer,
